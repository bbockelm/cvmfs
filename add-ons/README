s3rewrite.py
A sample rewrite script that can be used if a repository is stored using
multiple buckets.  In such a case, the logical location under which clients
access the repository needs to be rewritten to the different bucket URLs.
Spreading a repository over multiple bucket URLs has been developed as a
performance optimization for the Huawei UDS system and so far has not been
applied elsewhere.
